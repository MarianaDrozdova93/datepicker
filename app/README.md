# App for development and e2e testing

## Installation

- go to date-picker itself and run `npm link`
- than in the `app` folder run `npm i && npm run link:dp`

## Development

- run date-picker in watch mode `npm run build:watch`
- run app `npm start`

## Troubleshooting

Sometimes you can't see any logs from linked date-picker.
Maybe `npm run clean:link` will help you.
